# advent-of-code-2022

For my code for https://adventofcode.com/2022

I'm feeling pretty COVID brain still, so my approach is minimal; solve the problem, with small nods to elegance and efficiency.

I'm using Python, simply because that's what I'm programming in most at the moment, to keep it easy for myself.

Note this starts at Day 5, because I didn't think to capture my solutions from earlier days.
